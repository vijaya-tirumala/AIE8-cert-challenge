## üéØ Task 1: Defining your Problem and Audience

### The Opportunity 
**Write a succinct 1-sentence description of the problem**

Empower Solution Engineers to quickly and accurately respond to customer RFPs and solution design questions by providing instant, AI-powered access to product knowledge from acquired company documentation ‚Äî eliminating manual search and knowledge gaps.

### Persona Context and Why
**Write 1-2 paragraphs on why this is a problem for your specific user**

Solution Engineers in enterprise technology companies face significant challenges when working with acquired company technologies:

1. **Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck**: 15-20 hours spent searching through thousands of pages of documentation
2. **Inconsistent Responses**: Manual RFP responses lead to inconsistent messaging and potential errors
3. **Rapid Ramp-up Requirements**: Post-acquisition scenarios require immediate expertise in new product lines
4. **Scalability Issues**: Manual processes don't scale with growing product portfolios

This problem is particularly acute in M&A scenarios where Solution Engineers must rapidly become experts on acquired company technologies to support customer RFPs, solution design, and technical integration. The manual process of searching through extensive documentation creates bottlenecks that delay deal closure, reduce response quality, and increase the risk of providing inaccurate or incomplete information to customers.

### Business Impact
- ‚è≥ **75% Reduction** in documentation search time
- üìÑ **Consistent, Approved Messaging** across all responses
- üöÄ **Increased Deal Velocity** through faster response times
- üí¨ **Improved Customer Confidence** with accurate, cited responses
- üß† **Reduced Training Ramp Time** for new technologies

## üìä Task 3: Dealing with the Data

### Data Sources and External APIs
**Deliverable: Describe all of your data sources and external APIs, and describe what you'll use them for.**

| Source | Type | Size | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| **Sample Product Specifications** | Markdown | 2,847 words | Core product documentation and technical specifications |
| **Sample RFP Responses** | Markdown | 2,156 words | Pre-approved response templates and best practices |
| **Sample Technical FAQ** | Markdown | 1,892 words | Knowledge base with common questions and answers |
| **M&A Solution Engineer Questions** | Markdown | 1,200 words | Specialized M&A integration scenarios |

**Total Documentation**: ~6,895 words (~27-35 pages)

### Chunking Strategy
**Deliverable: Describe the default chunking strategy that you will use. Why did you make this decision?**

```python
# Optimized Chunking Configuration
chunk_size = 800  # tokens - preserves technical context
chunk_overlap = 100  # tokens - prevents information loss
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=chunk_size,
    chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap,
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]
)
```

**Rationale:**
- **800-token chunks**: Preserves complex technical context while maintaining processing efficiency
- **100-token overlap**: Ensures continuity across chunk boundaries
- **Recursive splitting**: Respects natural document structure and semantic boundaries

### Expected Chunk Distribution
- Product Specifications: ~12-15 chunks
- RFP Responses: ~9-11 chunks
- Technical FAQ: ~8-10 chunks
- M&A Questions: ~6-8 chunks
- **Total**: ~35-44 chunks
