# M&A and Solution Engineer Focused RFP Questions

## Due Diligence & Technical Assessment

### Q: What are the key technical risks and dependencies when integrating this platform into an acquired company's existing infrastructure?
**Expected Response**: The platform requires careful assessment of existing data infrastructure, network connectivity, security policies, and compliance requirements. Key risks include data migration complexity, integration with legacy systems, and potential downtime during transition. Dependencies include Java JDK 11+, minimum 64GB RAM, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity.

### Q: How does the platform handle data migration from legacy systems during an M&A integration?
**Expected Response**: The platform supports comprehensive data migration through multiple ingestion methods including batch processing with Apache Spark, real-time streaming via Kafka/Pulsar, API-based migration, and file format support for CSV, JSON, Parquet, and Avro. Migration can be performed incrementally with minimal downtime.

### Q: What is the estimated timeline and resource requirements for implementing this platform in a newly acquired subsidiary?
**Expected Response**: Implementation timeline typically ranges from 3-6 months depending on data volume and complexity. Resource requirements include dedicated technical team (2-3 engineers), infrastructure setup (16+ CPU cores, 64GB+ RAM), and comprehensive training program. The platform offers phased deployment options to minimize business disruption.

## Solution Engineering & Custom Implementation

### Q: How can the platform be customized to meet specific client requirements in a complex enterprise environment?
**Expected Response**: The platform offers extensive customization through RESTful APIs, configurable RBAC permissions, custom data connectors, and integration with enterprise systems (SAP, Oracle, Salesforce). Solution engineers can leverage the platform's modular architecture to create client-specific implementations while maintaining core functionality.

### Q: What support is available for Solution Engineers during client implementations and troubleshooting?
**Expected Response**: Comprehensive support includes dedicated Solution Engineer resources, 24x7 technical support with 1-hour response time for critical issues, on-site implementation assistance, custom training programs, and access to detailed API documentation with examples. Enterprise support includes dedicated support team with custom SLA.

### Q: How does the platform handle multi-tenant scenarios common in M&A situations where multiple business units need isolated data access?
**Expected Response**: The platform provides fine-grained RBAC with column-level permissions, tenant isolation through configurable access controls, and support for multiple deployment models including hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. This enables secure data segregation while maintaining centralized management capabilities.

## M&A Integration & Operational Continuity

### Q: What are the compliance and regulatory considerations when integrating this platform across different geographic regions in an M&A scenario?
**Expected Response**: The platform meets multiple compliance standards including SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA (optional), and PCI DSS (optional). It supports multi-region deployment with data residency controls, ensuring compliance with local regulations while maintaining operational continuity across acquired entities.

### Q: How does the platform ensure business continuity during M&A integration without disrupting ongoing operations?
**Expected Response**: The platform provides 99.9% SLA with automatic failover, multi-region replication with RTO < 1 hour, incremental backup capabilities with point-in-time recovery, and phased deployment options. These features enable seamless integration while maintaining operational continuity and minimizing business disruption.

### Q: What cost optimization strategies are available when consolidating multiple acquired companies onto this platform?
**Expected Response**: Cost optimization includes per-core licensing based on actual usage, tiered pricing for data volume, hybrid deployment options combining on-premises and cloud resources, and intelligent auto-scaling to match demand. The platform's linear scaling capabilities ensure cost efficiency as the organization grows through acquisitions.

## Technical Architecture & Scalability

### Q: How does the platform's architecture support the rapid scaling requirements common in post-M&A growth scenarios?
**Expected Response**: The platform supports horizontal scaling up to 10,000 nodes with linear scaling capabilities, handles petabytes of data efficiently, and supports up to 50,000 concurrent users. Its cloud-native design with auto-scaling ensures rapid capacity expansion to meet post-M&A growth demands.

### Q: What integration capabilities exist for connecting acquired companies' existing BI tools and analytics platforms?
**Expected Response**: The platform provides native integration with major BI tools including Tableau, Power BI, Looker, QlikView, and MicroStrategy. It supports standard data connectors, RESTful APIs for custom integrations, and maintains compatibility with existing analytics workflows to minimize disruption during M&A integration.

### Q: How does the platform handle data governance and lineage tracking across multiple acquired entities?
**Expected Response**: The platform provides comprehensive audit logging, data lineage tracking, and governance controls through fine-grained RBAC. It maintains complete audit trails for compliance requirements and supports data governance policies across multiple entities while ensuring data integrity and regulatory compliance.
